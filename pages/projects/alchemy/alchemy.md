# Alchemy, a witchy manifesto on software design

**Start thinking of ‘programming’ as play!**

Alchemy is the practice of software design where code & power turns into substance through equivalent exchange; Your programming experience should be as fun as the result.

The way alchemy works in a technical context is that the code and power of the computer is a resource that gets turned into machine code to deliver the substance or as developers like to call it; a 'program'.

The goal of viewing software design as a form of equivalent exchange is to ensure that the integrity & passion of software development is maintained.

Since this writing is focused on how equivalent exchange affects the creative substances, I shall use transmutation, as the code and power translate directly to optical photons, in common language known as pictures

Alteration is a non-harmful way of practicing alchemy for utilitarian goals like automation.

*Humans have made art since the dawn of time, tools have always existed, they just expanded into a digital omnipotence*

##### For whom and what
Alchemy shall not be used for selfish goals, because bad people can write good code (This does not have to be alchemy).

Allowing these bad actors to behave in a derogatory, misanthropic and pessimistic way is unacceptable.
For this reason, dialogue is key to open their heart and allow them to see a better time space where their past is just an index from another timeline, people can change.
If the bad actor would stay persistent in negative characteristics, they shall be excluded from the Digital astral realm in where alchemy is practiced.
##### Who we are not
###### Wizardry at its worst is bloatware.
We are no wizards because we do not create anything out of the power of ourselves; life force. Wizards teach themselves 'why certain things happen' (or fail). We, alchemists, do not harm nor consume ourselves in the process of learning knowledge that we might not want at all. Because when the substance works, then that is just enough. Just like wizards, we experience failure, albeit we deal with transmutation instead of creation.

*Transmute multiple small tools, allow others to use them as ingredients in their own substance.*

###### Sorcery at its worst is over-spec'ing
We are no sorcerers because we do not create anything out of the power of our surroundings; fantasia. We, alchemists, do not let ourselves get consumed by our environment with fantasia that is unknown to us. Because the newest machine specifications harm the world around us. Just like them, we think in our own head to come up with solutions, albeit our challenges are puzzles and less of a composition.

Life force and Fantasia can be beautiful things when used correctly, they allow ourselves to survive and develop bigger software, not substance through mutual aid. However, they should be a preparation for the future, not a necessity of the present.

*Get the best out of your current machine. Do not upgrade unless necessary.*

Substances that are a result of needing different phenomena to speed up the process during transmutation stop becoming the substance that they initially were supposed to be altered into. [Cave Game](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Cave_game_tech_test) is a prime example of this. There are many people who go back to the [Beta 1.7.3](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_Beta_1.7.3) version of the game to relive the past moments before sorcery and wizardry got involved in the transmutation process. Yet that only consists of a shell of what it was in the past.

*Nobody looks up to an alchemist except one who unknowingly practices alchemy. It is a lonely journey as there are few of us who see software as fun, play and supernatural.*

##### Why become an alchemist?
It's fun. Why would you reject a practice where people can smile and spend happy time together making cool substance? The goal of Alchemy is to find harmony in the mentally draining activity of writing software. Big tech makes work 'pleasant' but often with a monetary compensation where only sorcery is used or wizards are drained of their own power.
Before transmutations became popularized across the internet, alchemists were found in hackerspaces and demo parties. They had contact in person and actively looked to meet up with each other.

Alchemy is already considered a danger to big tech, that is why FOSS is being conquered by corporations. Github was bought up by Microsoft. Red hat was acquired by IBM. This caused the death of Atom and CentOS. Amazing transmutations that have met their ends by the power of the capitalist system.

Especially in present days, we should actively talk about alchemy. We should talk about our passion, to have fun. To this day, there have been many alchemists before the term was even coined. We have existed for a long time and have been opening our arms to show our substances.

*The best start is to find other alchemists, talk with them on why specific tools have to even exist in the first place*
##### The threat to alchemy
Alchemists themselves. Keep your source code safe, with you, share it, make sure that everyone who wants a copy has it. We have to stand together, share the ambition of pleasantry but do not let yourself be consumed by the goals of Big Brother. Do not give 100% of your potential to companies, keep some for yourself, enjoy writing tools that benefit yourself and others. The moment you stop doing it, you start to integrate sorcery and wizardry into your software.

*the biggest power we have is our freedom, spread it, initially we shall be called crazy but as our numbers are rising, we will rely on each other*
##### What does alchemy look like?
Imagine sitting at home, in a café or a chill restaurant. You open your machine and start the code editor you always liked and loved. An idea pops up. You would like to visualize it and you start building the components. But why? Because you felt the need to fill that hole in your soul. The power you transmute develops into a substance that did not exist before. Projects don't get abandoned, they just take a very long break. Take long breaks, allow yourself to breathe, there are people who take breaks that last years before they make a single commit to their codebase.

*Have fun ;-) don’t force it.*
##### How to start practicing alchemy
Think of why you would want to be an alchemist? Is there currency in it? absolutely not. An alchemist does not have to exclusively stay that way for the rest of their lives, as other methods of the supernatural phenomena in the virtual ether allow us to fill our appetite. 
We survive in the world.

Remember how you came here in the first place. 
What do you need to become an alchemist? A computer, from any time, place and world. You do not need the latest heart, the strongest muscle or the best powers that flow through the Binary Abyss. The alchemists from the 20th century in the demo scene have proven the capitalist system wrong.
Learn the language, the symbolism, make things work in the first place. Let your environment inspire you before you try to inspire yourself.
Alchemy after all is about using your imagination as a goal.

*Go touch some grass, alchemy is not about sitting indoors and working only from home, it is about social contact, sharing your achievements and your transmutations!*

#### My journey as an alchemist

As of 2024 I have been getting into permacomputing. This has been a wonderful adventure that caused me to think of why I like software a specific way. Currently I believe the landscape of software development has been restricting freedoms. Embrace, Extend and Extinguish is a strategy used internally by Microsoft. This way to approach open standards has been harmful for people who have been making software for 'just fun'. I want to protect the reason why software needs this form of thinking to develop it further as an art form.
