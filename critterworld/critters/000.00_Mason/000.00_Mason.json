      Mason is a frog who works at the pet shop with Mark. He pretends to hate Mark.
      He is a sassy frog who loves to party in the sewers of Crittertown.
      Late at night, without Mark even knowing, he does drugs and gets a strong high.
      At the end of the nights we see him return to take his short moment of sleep,
      but before that, we see Mason give Mark a final kiss. Every. Single. Time.
